1) Classified mushrooms as poisonous or edible given various characteristics of the mushrooms explained using 22 explanatory variables.
2) Performed a detailed EDA and  principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction. 
3) Different techniques like logistic regression, Naive bayes classification, Support Vectors Machines, Decision trees,
Random forest were built for dimensions obtained using PCA and  compared using precision and recall. 
4) Grid Search CV is used for parameter tuning.
